## Contributing ＼(＾O＾)／
This project comes with an SBT wrapper script that will automatically download the correct version of SBT and Scala. All you have to do is running the following command from the root of the project

```
./sbt
```

This will fire up the SBT repl where you can begin issuing commands. For example to run the tests you would simply type ```test``` into the SBT repl.  If you don't want to use the repl you can also run the test suite from your normal command prompt using the following command:

```
./sbt test
```
