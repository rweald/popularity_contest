Recommendations and requirements for how to best contribute to popularity_content. 
We strive to obey these as best as possible. 
As always, thanks for contributing--we hope these guidelines make it easier and shed some light on our approach and processes.

###Key branches

```master``` is the latest, development version.
Tags are created for each maven release.

###Pull requests

Create your changes on a branch and then submit pull requests against our master branch.
Try not to pollute your pull request with unintended changes--keep them simple and small

Try and keep your pull request as up to date with master as possible. The chances of your changes
being merged are substantially higher if they can be merged automatically without conflicts.

Changes that break the test suite will not be merged. Please ensure that your changes leave the build
green. Also don't forget to add or update tests to coincide with your changes
